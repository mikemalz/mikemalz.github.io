<h3>Oh. Hello! I dident see you there.</h3>
<div>
	<p>Born and raised in the suburbs of <a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, Mike has always had an interest in being creative, and using technology. During his four years at <a href="http://wpsk12.com/">Wilmington High School,</a> Mike excelled in computer-based courses, and became known as a computer guru around the school. Mike also took all the art courses that the High School had to offer, from black and white photography, to clay sculpture. Mike graduated Wilmington High in 2002, and unsure what he wanted to do, attended <a href="https://www.middlesex.mass.edu/">Middlesex Community College in Bedford Massachusetts.</a>
	</p>

	<p>After taking a design course at the school, he realized that he wanted to use computers to make art. Mixing technology and the creative, to make a final product. The following year Mike applied to and was accepted at University of Hartfordâ€™s, <a href="http://www.hartfordartschool.org/">Hartford Art School</a>, setting his sights on a Visual Design Communication degree, however, moving later to Media Arts degree, with a minor in Visual Design Communication.</p> 
</div>
<div>
	<p>The move introduced him to something he had never put much thought into; making interactive artwork. Mike took on projects such as creating a touch screen tabletop, using Frustrated Total Internal Reflection (FTIR) augmented reality, and motion tracking interaction.</p>

	<p>While attending Hartford Art School, Mike worked first at Radio Shack for a year, moving to a Specialist position at <a herf="http://apple.com">Apple</a> Retail for the next three years. During this time he became, skilled in everything apple, from software, sales, and answering technical questions. After leaving Apple, Mike started his own freelance company called <a href="http://mike.maleszky.com">Maleszyk Design<a/>, where he acts as creative director for video, print, and websites for small business clients. Mike moved back to the Boston area after graduating from Hartford Art School in 2010, where he continues his work at Malzak Design.</p></div>
